No hot plugging. Assumes that CPU is not involved in synchronization process. No MDIO initialization is required. SyncIn0 is used to distribute a reference clock to all PHYs. FrameSync only, at rate = 1 kHz. DPLL is used to lock to SyncIn0 signal. 2'b11: Assumes that PHYs do not share the same TX clock. Hot plugging allowed. Assumes that a CPU is involved: CPU can control the SyncIn0/1 signal going to the PHYs (via some simple FPGA, or using SyncOut on one of the PHYs). CPU will issue MDIO commands, to be executed on next FrameSync (on SyncIn0 or SyncIn1 inputs). DPLL is used to lock to SyncIn0 Signal.

Following are the UDF definition. .UDF_n_A0,.......,UDF_n_A8: These UDFs are used by IPv4 packets for Slice n.(n = 0,1 or 2) .UDF_n_B0,.......,UDF_n_B8: These UDFs are used by IPv6 packets for Slice n.(n = 0,1 or 2) .UDF_n_C0,.......,UDF_n_C8: These UDFs are used by Non-IP packets for Slice n.(n = 0,1 or 2) .UDF_n_D0,.......,UDF_n_D11: These UDFs are used by IPv6 packet for the Chain Slice. Cfg_UDF_n_X[N][7:5]: the offset base 000: Start of frame; 010: End of L2; 011: End of L3; Others: Reserved Cfg_UDF_n_X[N][4:0]: the offset=N indicate the UDF starts from the location 2N bytes after the location implied by the offset base.
